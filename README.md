# FlatFinder - Team Ramen

Hi! This is our project for the new flat. Over the course of 3 weeks, our team built **FlatFinder**, a web app that helps landlords and renters find the flats they prefer.

## Team Members
- **Developer A:** Zoe  
- **Developer B:** Ryushin  

## Communication
We’ll mainly talk things through during class to work out any issues.  
If needed, we’ll also use Microsoft Teams to make sure we’re on the same page.
